# TODO: Fix Streamlit App Issues - COMPLETED ✓

## 1. Fix Code Display Language ✓
- [x] Update `st.code` calls to use `result['language']` instead of hardcoded 'python'
- [x] Added proper language mapping for Python, C++, and Java

## 2. Make AI Generation Language-Aware ✓
- [x] Enhanced `generate_code_with_ollama` with language-specific prompts
- [x] Added difficulty level assessment ([DIFFICULTY: level] format)
- [x] Improved Java, C++, and Python code generation
- [x] Added language-specific syntax examples

## 3. Dynamic Visualizations ✓
- [x] Modified `create_performance_visualizations` to accept theme, search results, and language
- [x] Added search results visualizations (similarity scores, lines of code)
- [x] Made visualizations language-specific with proper titles

## 4. Enhance Light Theme CSS ✓
- [x] Fixed white theme with !important declarations
- [x] Ensured all text is black and visible on light background
- [x] Added proper color specifications for all elements

## 5. Language Detection & Selection ✓
- [x] Added dynamic language selection showing available snippet counts
- [x] Improved language filtering in search results
- [x] Enhanced code display with actual language from data

## 6. Ollama Integration ✓
- [x] Verified Ollama API working with gemma3 model
- [x] Enhanced prompts for better code generation
- [x] Added difficulty assessment and color coding
- [x] Tested Java code generation successfully

## 7. Auto-Save & Retrain System ✅
- [x] Created separate Java CSV dataset (data_java.csv)
- [x] Added auto-save functionality for generated code
- [x] Implemented automatic model retraining after saves
- [x] Added manual retrain button in sidebar
- [x] Language-specific CSV handling (Python, C++, Java)
- [x] Real-time dataset metrics with last updated timestamps
- [x] Tested auto-save with all three languages

## 8. Difficulty Selection & Complexity Analysis ✅
- [x] Added difficulty level selector (Easy/Intermediate/Advanced)
- [x] Enhanced code generation with difficulty-specific prompts
- [x] Implemented code complexity analysis functions
- [x] Created visual complexity graphs (Lines, Complexity Score, Structure)
- [x] Added difficulty match validation system
- [x] Real-time metrics display (Lines, Complexity, Control Structures)
- [x] Difficulty-aware auto-save with proper classification
- [x] Tested complexity analysis with sample codes

## All Issues Fixed!
The app now properly:
- Generates code in Java, C++, and Python using Ollama
- Shows difficulty levels with color coding
- Displays code with correct syntax highlighting
- Has working light/dark themes
- Shows dynamic visualizations based on search results
- **Auto-saves generated code to improve accuracy over time**
- **Retrains embeddings automatically for better recommendations**
- **Maintains separate datasets for each programming language**
- **Allows difficulty selection (Easy/Intermediate/Advanced) for code generation**
- **Provides real-time complexity analysis with visual graphs**
- **Validates generated code matches requested difficulty level**
- **Shows comprehensive code metrics and structure breakdown**
